ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing Summary:- 

This project applies essential data preprocessing steps to prepare the Titanic dataset for machine learning: Handled Missing Data: Filled Age with median Filled Embarked with mode Dropped Cabin due to excessive missing values

Categorical Encoding: Used label encoding for Sex and Embarked Feature Scaling Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler

Outlier Detection: Visualized with boxplots Removed outliers using the IQR method

Why It Matters: Preprocessing improves model performance by cleaning, transforming, and scaling data, making it easier for algorithms to learn patterns effectively.
